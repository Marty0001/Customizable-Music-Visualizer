Personal mp3-player project with the goal of adding as much customizability to audio visualization as possible. I used edited code from https://gitlab.com/avirzayev/medium-audio-visualizer-code/-/blob/master/main.py as the skeleton. To run, use pip install -r requirements.txt, change the audio file name in main.py if needed, and it should be good to go.
